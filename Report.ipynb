    "###Historical Background <a id=\"HistoricalBackground\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "With the ever-growing expansion and widespread acceptance of the internet the field of research in distributed systems \n",
    "is gaining evermore importance. In its simplest definition, a distributed system is a group of different processors working together on a common task. These processors have a shared state, operate concurrently and can fail independently. The primary \n",
    "advantages of a distributed system over a centralized system are scalability, fault-tolerance and low latency. There are however some drawbacks to the decentralized nature of these networks. The most notable being resource-management.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A particular example of distributed systems are peer-to-peer networks, also known as P2P networks. A peer-to-peer network allows computers to communicate without the need for a central server. Peer-to-peer file sharing refers to the distribution of digital media over a P2P network, in which the files are located on individuals' computers and shared with other members of the network, rather than on a centralized server. P2P software was the piracy method of choice in the early 2000s with software programs such as LimeWire, Gnutella and the Bittorent client being the most prominent sites. A Supreme Court decision in 2005 led to the closureof many of these sites for illegally sharing copyrighted material, mostly music.â€‹\n",
    "\n",
    "In a peer-to-peer file sharing network agents up- and download files over the network to one another in a cooperative manner, whereby\n",
    "an agent that is holding a file (or at least a part of it) can offer it to other agents that require it, through actions called seeding and leeching. Seeders are those who offer upload bandwidth while leechers are the agents that only download. However, such systems have a clear and fundamental problem: users have an obvious incentive to download, but no inherent incentive to upload.\n",
    "Early file sharing networks such as the BitTorrent protocoll employ a tit-for-tat strategy to incentivize its users to participate reciprocally. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tit-for-tat is an effective strategy in game theory for the prisoner's dilemma , in which one agent cooperates first and then replicates it's opponents previous actions. Peers in the BitTorrent network have a limited number of upload slots to allocate. An agent will begin by exchanging upload bandwidth for download bandwidth with a number of its peers. If one of these peers turns out to be a leecher, i.e. does not reciprocate, it will be *choked*. This means the agent will discontinue it's cooperation and assign the corresponding upload slot to another randomly chosen peer; a process that is known as *optimistic unchoking*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting agents do not keep a memory about their peer's reliability which enables forms of freeriding and other types of uncooperative behavior. There is no mechanism with which peers can be evaluated based on their reliability or trustworthiness as nodes in the network. The Blockchain Lab of the TU Delft aims to solve this problem exactly: Is it possible to incorporate a digital counterpart to trust in a distributed network with not central authority? Their peer-to-peer file sharing network called *Tribler* leverages social phenomena such as social networks and friendships in an attempt to optimize the traditional BitTorrent protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "###Trustchain  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build such a digital reputation scheme a distribued storage space or ledger is required. The Tribler application applies their own type of blockchain called *Trustchain*. The trustchain maintains records of all interactions between peers in the network, in respective blocks. Each block contains data about an individual transaction between two peers, such as the respective up-and download values, the peers' public keys and signatures as well as block sequence numbers and respective hashes. Blocks are linked to one another through hash pointers. Each block is then connected to two preceding and two succeeding blocks. This results in many different chains, each corresponding a single agent's transaction history.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "When two agents interact with one another they share their chains with eachother and may even store information about each other's chains as well. This structure is strongly scalable, both in the number of agents in the network as well as in the number of transactions per agent. Moreover, the trustchain does not maintain a global consensus. This means that double-spends are not actually prevented as they are in traditional blockchains. However, they are made detectable and can subsequently be penalized through peer rejection or even by banning dishonest nodes from the network. Thereby fraudulent activity is not prevented but strongly disincentivized.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Problem Description\n",
    "As discussed in [Historical Background](#HistoricalBackground) the long standing issue of tribler is digitizing a method for evaluating the trustworthiness of nodes. In this project we aimed at implementing a ranking of nodes in the tribler network based on their respective contribution made to the network and their subsequent value for the network. When a node is looking to query an overlay for a file to download   \n",
